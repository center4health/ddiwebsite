						<h4><strong>Designing for People Living With Diabetes </strong> </h4>
					</div>

					<p> Our design students began by listening and learning about their users; people living with
						diabetes, their parents and loved ones. The challenges of managing diabetes are complicated and
						multidimensional. It was important for our students to understand these challenges from multiple
						points of view. These lessons from interviews with people living with diabetes, family and
						healthcare providers
						filled in the gaps for their design approaches.
					</p>
					<p><em>“Thank you all for the work you're doing. It's both the big things and the little things that
							make living with diabetes every day a little better.”</em><br>
						Chris, Participant
					</p>
					<p>
						Interviews were conducted using video communications followed by need-finding to discover a
						user’s needs and opportunities for improvements with their continuous glucose monitors.
						Students used personas, empathy mapping and user journeys and weekly workshops with Dexcom
						stakeholders to extract key insights to help guide their design process.
					</p>
					<p>Over several weeks, four teams built on insights from patient interviews and conducted
						weekly participatory design sessions to guide and define potential troubleshooting designs.

							<h4><strong>Experience &amp Insights</strong> </h4>
						</div>


						<p>
							Students learned about diabetes management: the challenges and opportunities of using a
							continuous glucose monitor. They also heard from parents and their support networks
							including
							care teams from UCSD Health Systems and worked with a Dexcom interdisciplinary team. The
							design
							workshop was conducted by remote collaboration using Zoom, Figma and Miro. The
							applications allowed for rapid iteration and constant feedback.
						</p>
						<p>
							Students learned from and tested their ideas with 25 participants varying in age (14 to 71),
							ethnicity, gender, and level of experience with continuous glucose monitoring. They also
							worked
							with healthcare providers: Endocrinologists, Physician Assistants, Nurse Practitioners and
							Pharmacists managing patients with diabetes via Telemedicine.
						</p>
						<p><em>“DDI was an amazing learning experience! I’m so grateful to have worked with real
								industry professionals at Dexcom who provided wonderful mentorship and guidance that
								pushed me to grow immensely as a designer and researcher.”</em><br>
								Amanda, Design Student
						<p>
							Our design students and Dexcom stakeholders learned from our users who provided deep insight
							into the many challenges of managing diabetes. The technology of continuous glucose
							monitoring has given people with diabetes so much hope in their ability but has also shown
							new opportunities for improvement, meaningful data and ways to receive support both online
							and offline.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our students experienced an opportunity to move the needle forward in our future of health.
							Together with the support of the diabetes community, the future is very bright.
