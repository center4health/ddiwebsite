            <h4><strong>Cognitive Continuity: Don’t Drop the Patient</strong> </h4>
          </div>

          <p>Healthcare is increasingly fragmented as patients shuttle between clinics, hospitals, and their own homes to receive the most appropriate and cost-effective care. As patients move between contexts, gaps in care, errors, and miscommunication often occur. We are studying how to reduce these adverse events by building tools that help patients and providers maintain *cognitive continuity*. To us cognitive continuity means everyone on the care team (patients included) appropriately understands the patient’s condition, the care being provided, and reasoning behind that care. In that vein we are studying how to help patients transition in and out of hospitals: on the one hand developing tools to help clinicians rapidly review their colleagues’ notes to understand the patient’s past care, and on the other developing tools to facilitate discussions between patients and providers as they return home.</p>
          
			<p>Unprecedented scales and types of data, the rapid pace of its accumulation, and disappearing disciplinary boundaries bring exciting new scientific and engineering opportunities but also challenge the traditional structure of scientific research and training. This structure is further challenged by the increasingly need of science and engineering students and researchers to develop expertise not only in the literature and methods of their field but also with techniques required to design systems involving complex interactions between people and technology. Moreover, new methods for collaboration and explorations of team science will become increasingly important as we tackle every more challenges and complex socio-technical problems. </p>
			<p>To meet these needs we propose a novel mix of practice and theory, of Thinking, Observing, and Making: TOM. We want to produce major works that advance the state of knowledge and leave a lasting heritage. Let TOM define our approach. Thinking and Making, but always for the benefit of people, hence the importance of Observing. The goal of design is to produce products, services, and systems. It is the science and practice of making.</p>
			
			<p><a href="http://designlab.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">The Design Lab</a> is located within the California Institute of Telecommunication and Information Technology, which gives us freedom to move seamlessly across all the departments, schools, and divisions of the university. Our advisory board includes people from Management, Engineering, Visual Arts, Theater, and the Social Sciences.”</p>
